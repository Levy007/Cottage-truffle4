I have used the Ownership design pattern as it is related to what the online decentralized marketplace demanded.

The interaction of buyers an sellers needed a simple design pattern where users could interact easily with the DApp making it user friendly to use.

The ownership design pattern not only allows for a simple process to take place but also helps to keep track of all the transactions that are taking place at the EVENT section.
